## Installation procedure
After installing the dependencies, you can build our propsed MPC package as follows:
``` 
cd your_catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/Houman-HM/vacna
cd .. && catkin build
source your_catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```
## Running the algorithm

In order to run the MPC for the warehouse inventory, follow the procedure below:

### In the first terminal:
```
roslaunch vacna warehouse.launch
```

This launches a warehouse environment in Gazebo.
### In the second terminal:

#### For the MPC with Gaussian Initialization:

```
rosrun vacna planner_gaussian.py
```
#### For the MPC with CVAE Initialization:
```
rosrun vacna planner_cvae.py
```
